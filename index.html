                    Hello, I am Rahul Shah. Currently, I am a graduate student at Pace University, Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems.
                    Throughout my academic history, I've had the privilege of working on many projects including Development of Atharva College's Sports Website, Detection of Osteoporosis Fractures and Building a Gym Database. My next step is to face cutting-edge technological issues through obtaining a full-time opportunity and consequently problem-solve complex technical problems.
                </p>
                <p class="second">Due to my natural curiosity in technology, it has been my quest to discover as much as I can about Web Development - and learn the ins and outs about Computer Science.
                </p>
